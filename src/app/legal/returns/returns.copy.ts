### Return Policy ###

Quadri does NOT accept returns on our products to avoid any inconsistencies in our inventory. We recommend that you view multiple samples before placing an order. Please note that samples are not an exact replica of a full tile order, but they give you a sense of the collection's look and feel. We suggest ordering three to four samples of the same product to help you get a sense for the level of variation.

**Important!**
Any Quadri shortage or damage must be noted upon receipt of the product and written in detailed notes on the BOL/Delivery Receipt. All inspections of tiles must be done prior to installation and within 48 hours of delivery. In all tile realms, installation constitutes acceptance of the materials. Please do not install defective products.

### Standard Cancellation Policy ###

Quadri only accepts cancellations within 3 hours from the time your confirmation email is sent. Outside of this timeframe, orders cannot be canceled. Please note that this 3-hour window also applies to editing or adding to a full order placed with Quadri.

To cancel your order within 3 hours from the time the order confirmation was sent, please either email us at contact@quadritile.com.

### Order Edit Policy ###

After the 3-hour time limit has expired, Quadri can no longer make any changes to your order. This includes reducing, adding, editing, or canceling the order. Please take note of this and plan accordingly.

Important!

All lead times and delivery dates are estimates, and various factors might delay an order. Please anticipate potential delays with any tile order. Once your order has been sent to the production studio, Quadri cannot cancel the order, even if the tile has not shipped yet.

### Quadri Sale and Special Events Cancellation Policy ###

On the rare occasion that Quadri offers a sale event - please note that the standard cancellation policy may not apply. Please read the terms and conditions of each specific sale event to ensure you understand the policies for each sale. For sales and sale items, our sale terms and conditions will always supersede our general terms and conditions for cancellations.

### Right to Refuse Business ###

An order may be terminated by Quadri for any reason or for no reason upon Quadri giving one day notice to customers.
